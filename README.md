## Inspired by:

https://github.com/playfultechnology/audio-guestbook

## Why this setup:
I don't have any Teensy or Audio Board for Teensy 4 hardware and I don't want to buy any extra for a 1 time use.

But have Raspberry Pi 4 and USB soundcard.

Due to NAudio only working on windows the Raspberry Pi 4 is running Windows 11.
